# Humanitarian OpenStreetMap

This project is my first contribution to FOSS.It contains selected social facility present within India that have been extracted and displayed with the help of Mapbox GL.

## Getting Started

The html code [index.html](https://github.com/aaronakku/HOT-OSM/blob/master/index.html) contains the set of OSM data that has been extracted from map tiles of India.
